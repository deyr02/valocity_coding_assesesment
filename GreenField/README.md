## Current knowledge On Card Games
I was not much familiar with card game. 

What I found from the Internet is 
	- There are 54 cards in a deck.
	- A deck is consist of 4 different suites of cards repectively Hearts, Diamond, Spades, and clubs.
	- Each of the sute has 13 different cards and the posistion or power of the cards are the followint 
			A (Ace), 2, 3, 4, 5, 6,7, 8,9,10, J(jack), Q(Queen), K(King)
	- Jack, Queen, King also known as Royal cards.
	- These four suites also divied into 2 color cokdes (Red and Black)
	- There also two additional card know as Joker. The special power of jack is the ability to becaone any card. 
	- The give can be played multiple ways and multipule player can be involved. 


As it is uncertain that which game need to be developed. 

As per given requirement, my attempt is to develop a deck of card in an object-oriented way, shaffle cards and distribute among four players.

###Development environment.
- I have choosen to butild the solution and logic in a console application
- It will enable me to find out the hidden requiements and the complexity.
