# Green Field Project

## Current knowledge On Card Games
I was not much familiar with card game. 

What I found from the Internet is 
#### There are 54 cards in a deck.
#### A deck is consist of 4 different suites of cards repectively Hearts, Diamond, Spades, and clubs.
#### Each of the sute has 13 different cards and the posistion or power of the cards are the followint 
####		A (Ace), 2, 3, 4, 5, 6,7, 8,9,10, J(jack), Q(Queen), K(King)
#### Jack, Queen, King also known as Royal cards.
#### These four suites also divied into 2 color cokdes (Red and Black)
#### There also two additional card know as Joker. The special power of jack is the ability to becaone any card. 
#### The give can be played multiple ways and multipule player can be involved. 


### As it is uncertain that which game need to be developed. 

As per given requirement, my attempt is to develop a deck of card in an object-oriented way, shaffle cards and distribute among four players.

###Development environment.
-I have choosen to butild the solution and logic in a console application
-It will enable me to find out the hidden requiements and the complexity. 


##Structure
#### The unitTest project named as TestGreenField
#### The actual console application named as GreenField

### It is assumed that, there are 4 player. Once card is shaffle and distributed. Each player will get 13 cards. 

### Each card object will hold the SuiteName and CardName
### Suite object will hold whole suite of cards.
### Deck object will hold all the cards (52). It will have a functionaliyt to shaffle the cards. 

### Each player object hold the name and a list of cards. 

## The Board is manily responible to add all the player and distribute cards amont the player.
